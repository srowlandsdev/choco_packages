1. Determine Package Use:

 Community Repository?
  Have Distribution Rights?
    If you are the software vendor OR the software EXPLICITLY allows
    redistribution and the total nupkg size will be under 200MB, you
    have the option to embed the binaries directly into the package to
    provide the most reliable install experience. Put the binaries
    directly into the tools folder, use `$fileLocation` (`$file`/
    `$file64`) and `Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage`/
    `Get-ChocolateyUnzip` in tools\chocolateyInstall.ps1. Additionally,
    fill out the LICENSE and VERIFICATION file (see 3 below and those
    files for specifics).

    NOTE: You can choose to download binaries at runtime, but be sure
     the download location will remain stable. See the next section.

  Do Not Have Distribution Rights?
    Download Location is Publicly Available?
      You will need to download the runtime files from their official
      location at runtime. Use `$url`/`$url64` and
      `Install-ChocolateyPackage`/`Install-ChocolateyZipPackage` in
      tools\chocolateyInstall.ps1.
    Download Location Is Same For All Versions?
      You still need to point to those urls, but you may wish to set up
      something like Automatic Updater (AU) so that when a new version
      of the software becomes available, the new package version
      automatically gets pushed up to the community repository. See
      https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/automatic-packages#automatic-updater-au

2. Determine Package Type:

- Zip Package - downloads or embeds and unpacks archives, may unpack
  and run an installer using `Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage` as a
  secondary step.
- Portable Package - Contains runtime binaries (or unpacks them as a
  zip package) - cannot require administrative permissions to install
  or use

3. Fill out the package contents:

- tools\LICENSE.txt / tools\VERIFICATION.txt - Remove if you are not
  embedding binaries. Keep and fill out if you are embedding binaries
  in the package AND pushing to the community repository, even if you
  are the author of software. The file becomes easier to fill out
  (does not require changes each version) if you are the software
  vendor. If you are building packages for internal use (organization,
  etc), you don't need these files as you are not subject to
  distribution rights internally.

4. ChocolateyInstall.ps1:

- Downloading binaries at runtime - use `$url`/`$url64` and
  `Install-ChocolateyPackage` / `Install-ChocolateyZipPackage`.
- Other needs (creating files, setting registry keys), use regular
  PowerShell to do so or see if there is a function already defined:
  https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions
- There may also be functions available in extension packages, see
  https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3A.extension for examples and
  availability.
- Clean out the comments and sections you are not using.

5. Test the package to ensure install/uninstall work appropriately.
 There is a test environment you can use for this -
